      question: "What's the difference between collision and comprehensive coverage?",
      answer: "Collision coverage pays for damage when your vehicle hits or is hit by another vehicle or object, or when your vehicle overturns. Comprehensive coverage protects against non-collision events like theft, fire, vandalism, weather damage, and falling objects. Most businesses need both types for complete protection.",
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: "Is physical damage insurance required by law?",
      answer: "While federal and state laws don't mandate physical damage coverage, it's often required by lenders or leasing companies if you're financing vehicles. Even for owned vehicles, it's essential protection given the high cost of commercial vehicle replacement and repairs.",
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: "How is my vehicle's value determined after a loss?",
      answer: "Insurers typically use Actual Cash Value (ACV), which factors in the vehicle's original cost minus depreciation, age, mileage, and condition. Some policies offer Stated Value coverage where you and the insurer agree on a value upfront, though payment at loss is still typically the lesser of stated value or ACV.",
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: "What does Gap coverage protect against?",
      answer: "Gap coverage protects you when your vehicle is totaled and you owe more on your loan or lease than the vehicle's actual cash value. It pays the difference between the insurance settlement and your remaining loan balance, preventing out-of-pocket expenses after a total loss.",
      isOpen: false
    },
    {
      question: "Are rental vehicles covered under physical damage insurance?",
      answer: "Standard physical damage coverage typically applies only to owned and specifically scheduled leased vehicles. However, you can add Hired Auto Physical Damage coverage to protect rental or borrowed vehicles you use for business purposes. This is essential if you regularly rent vehicles.",
      isOpen: false
